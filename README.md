- 👋 Hi, I’m @Odum-Destiny-Felinah
- 👀 I am a female folk navigating my way in the tech ecosystem with a resolve to use my current and growing skills to build solutions and support the development of products in the tech ecosystem.       
I am on a journey to advance, deploy my skills, and watch them blossom within result-yielding ventures/projects.
They call me Destiny of the good life. I am driven by my interest in solution building, innovation, mass construction, and deploying revolutionary tech tools. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning technical writing and project management for project developement 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with innovative projects in the tech ecosystem to develop, present, and communicate their business/project ideas through technical writing, research, written documentation, and management.  
I love that this ecosystem encourages me to explore and learn things I had little exposure to. This field challenges me, I've had moments of being utterly lost but this is how to grow. 
I love the innovative nature of this space, the chance to be creators and bring ideas to life, giving them a structure (body), Identity (brand), brain (teams) and breath (mission). 
Working with tech projects and solutions however I can to ensure the communication and success of the project through my writing/ management skills is the reason I am here.

It is most ardently fulfilling to contribute in fleshing out, communicating, and birthing projects and startups that would:
Develop a product/service that solves problems
Create employment opportunities for youths, especially in Africa
Create a network that allows people access opportunities 
Projects that empower other projects to come alive
